# Slide Editing

Slides are HTML content stored inside the deck JSON. Each slide's `content`
field is a self-contained HTML string rendered at the intrinsic dimensions for
its aspect ratio: 16:9 is 960x540, 1:1 is 1080x1080, 9:16 is 540x960, and 4:5
is 864x1080. These canonical dimensions come from the shared aspect-ratio
registry; do not assume a fixed 1920x1080 canvas.

A slide may also carry its own `size` (`{ width, height, preset? }` pixels),
which overrides the deck-level aspect ratio — this is how social projects
(`deck.kind: "social"`) give every asset its own canvas. Resolution order:
`slide.size` → deck `aspectRatio` → 960x540. Resize via
`update-slide --sizePreset <preset>` or `--width`/`--height`; the layout fit
check always measures against the slide's OWN resolved canvas, so after a
resize expect a fresh overflow report and rewrite the HTML for the new
geometry (see `create-social-assets` for per-format templates).

## Slide HTML Structure

Every slide uses this wrapper:

```html
<div class="fmd-slide" style="padding: 80px 110px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: flex-start;">
  <!-- Slide content here -->
</div>
```

## Styling Rules

All generated slides follow these conventions:

| Element | Style |
|---------|-------|
| Background | `bg-[#000000]` (pure black) |
| Font | `font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif` on all text |
| Section labels | `font-size: 16px; font-weight: 700; letter-spacing: 3px; text-transform: uppercase; color: #00E5FF` |
| Headings | `font-size: 40px; font-weight: 900; color: #fff; line-height: 1.15; letter-spacing: -1px` |
| Title slides | `font-size: 54px; font-weight: 900` with `justify-content: center` |
| Bullet points | `&#x25CF;` character (8px, white), gap: 20px, font-size: 22px, color: rgba(255,255,255,0.85) |
| Sub-bullets | `&#x25CB;` (open circle), padding-left: 36px |
| Bold terms | `<strong style="font-weight: 800; color: #fff;">Term</strong>` + description in rgba(255,255,255,0.55) |
| Accent color | `#00E5FF` (cyan) for section labels, emphasis, highlights |

## Updating a Slide

To edit a slide's content:

1. **Inspect the current context**: call `view-screen` to get the active deck,
   slide ID, HTML, and any `slides-selection` style/edit target.
2. **Retrieve before generating**: when the edit changes facts, brand language,
   or layout, follow the `creative-context` skill and query those roles
   separately. Respect opt-out, pinned packs, and the exact reuse ladder.
3. **Modify the content** HTML string for the intended slide. Preserve an
   approved native template or component when it already fits; generate
   net-new structure only when the relevant corpus is empty.
4. **Update the slide** with the `update-slide` action using `deckId`,
   `slideId`, and `fullContent`. Do not write deck rows directly or add raw
   full-deck writes for normal slide edits; use `patch-deck` for browser/editor
   changes.
5. For browser/editor code, enqueue granular deck operations through
   `patch-deck` / `DeckContext.tsx` instead of replacing the whole deck JSON.

If retrieval produces a new immutable context pack, keep its `contextPackId`
and reuse labels with the deck provenance. Existing slide HTML is not proof of
which source version influenced it.

## Freeform Canvas Objects

Manual text boxes and other freeform canvas objects are absolutely positioned
children of `.fmd-slide`. Give each one a stable `data-slide-object-id`:

```html
<div
  class="fmd-text-box"
  data-slide-object-id="slide-object-unique-id"
  style="position: absolute; left: 160px; top: 120px; width: 420px;"
>
  Editable text
</div>
```

- Preserve `data-slide-object-id` when updating, moving, resizing, or styling an
  existing object.
- Mint a new unique object ID when duplicating an object.
- Do not use runtime-only `data-mk-id` values in saved slide HTML.
- Keep generated flex and grid content in normal flow. Do not silently
  absolute-position a nested layout child just to make it draggable; create a
  deliberate freeform object instead.
- Build editable shapes with styled HTML elements such as `div`. Do not use
  inline SVG, which the slide sanitizer removes.

## Image Placeholders

For visual elements (diagrams, charts, photos), use placeholder divs:

```html
<div class="fmd-img-placeholder" style="width: 100%; height: 300px; border-radius: 12px;">
  Description of the image
</div>
```

Never try to recreate complex visuals with raw HTML/CSS. Use placeholders and generate proper images via the image generation flow.

## Brand Check After Edits

After editing slides on a deck that links a design system, run
`lint-deck-brand --deckId=<id>` and fix any findings the edit introduced
(replace flagged literals with the suggested token values via further
targeted edits). Skip it for pure copy changes that touch no styles.

## Slide Layouts

Common layout patterns:

- **Title slide**: Single centered heading, `justify-content: center`
- **Section divider**: Large single word, centered
- **Content**: Section label + heading + bullet list
- **Two-column**: Flex row with `gap: 40px`, text left, image right
- **Table**: CSS grid with alternating row backgrounds
